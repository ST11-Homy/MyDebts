  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 13, 2025</p>

  <p>
    <strong>My Debts</strong> is an offline mobile application designed to help users manage personal or business-related debt records. We value and respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how the app handles your information.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>My Debts does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data externally.</strong> All the information you enter in the app is saved locally on your device. The types of data you may choose to enter include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Customer or client’s first and last name</li>
    <li>Phone number</li>
    <li>Email address</li>
    <li>Business name (optional)</li>
    <li>Address (optional)</li>
    <li>Debt records such as amount, status, and date</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Offline Operation</h2>
  <p>
    This app operates fully offline. It does not require an internet connection to function and does not send any user data to external servers, cloud services, or third-party platforms.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Developer Access</h2>
  <p>
    As the developer, I do not have access to any data that you generate or store within the app. All data remains on your device, and there are no mechanisms in the app to transmit or sync this data elsewhere.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    All information is stored securely on your local device storage. You are solely responsible for managing your data, including backing it up or deleting it. Please be aware that if your device is lost or the data is deleted, it cannot be recovered.
  </p>

  <h2>5. No Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>My Debts</strong> does not use or integrate any third-party services, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Analytics or Firebase</li>
    <li>Advertising or marketing platforms (e.g., AdMob)</li>
    <li>Cloud storage or syncing systems</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Google Play Services</h2>
  <p>
    While the app itself does not collect or transmit user data, please note that <strong>Google Play</strong> may collect basic information about app usage, device type, and crash reports. This information is handled by Google under their own <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> and is not accessible to the app developer.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The app is intended for users aged <strong>13 years and older</strong>. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that a child under 13 has used this app and entered personal data, please contact us so we can assist accordingly.
  </p>

  <h2>8. User Rights and Control</h2>
  <p>
    You have complete control over your data. You may view, edit, or delete any entries directly within the app. The app does not track your behavior, access your entries, or request permissions beyond what is necessary for offline features.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>
    All icons, illustrations, animations, and other media used in <strong>My Debts</strong> are sourced from publicly available open-source or free-to-use repositories such as Flaticon, Freepik, Font Awesome, and LottieFiles. 
    Where attribution is required, it is provided in the app’s <strong>“Credits & Acknowledgements”</strong> screen in accordance with the original license agreements.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect improvements or legal requirements. Any changes will be made available in the app or on the app's listing page, along with the updated effective date.
